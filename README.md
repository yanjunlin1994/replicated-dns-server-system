# replicated-dns-server-system
Hi! This is a implementation of replicated commit-log based on Multi-Paxos that serves for replicated DNS server system. With this system, we can ensure the highly consistent, fault-tolerant replicated commit-log. It is very applicable to repliacted status machine. Feel free to download it :D
We are still developing the system and might have bugs in it. Please feel free to email us(yanjunl1@andrew.cmu.edu)
